\begin_layout Abstract
For Nature, the abstract is really an introductory paragraph set in bold
 type.
 This paragraph must be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fully referenced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and less than 180 words for Letters.
 This is the thing that is supposed to be aimed at people from other disciplines
 and is arguably the most important part to getting your paper past the
 editors.
 End this paragraph with a sentence like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here we show...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or something similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the body of the main text appears after the intro paragraph.
 Figure environments can be left in place in the document.

\begin_inset Caption Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Each figure legend should begin with a brief title for the whole figure
 and continue with a short description of each panel and the symbols used.
 For contributions with methods sections, legends should not contain any
 details of methods, or exceed 100 words (fewer than 500 words in total
 for the whole paper).
 In contributions without methods sections, legends should be fewer than
 300 words (800 words or fewer in total for the whole paper).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sections can only be used in Articles.
 Contributions should be organized in the sequence: title, text, methods,
 references, Supplementary Information line (if any), acknowledgements,
 interest declaration, corresponding author line, tables, figure legends.

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, a cover letter needs to be written with the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 should be considered for a wide-ranging journal like 
\shape slanted
Nature
\shape default
 instead of a more narrowly focussed journal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A 100 word or less summary aimed at a non-scientific audience, written at
 the level of a national newspaper.
 It may be used for 
\shape slanted
Nature
\shape default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The cover letter should state clearly what is included as the submission,
 including number of figures, supporting manuscripts and any Supplementary
 Information (specifying number of items and format).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The cover letter should also state the number of words of text in the paper;
 the number of figures and parts of figures (for example, 4 figures, comprising
 16 separate panels in total); a rough estimate of the desired final size
 of figures in terms of number of pages; and a full current postal address,
 telephone and fax numbers, and current e-mail address.
